# video-llava-7b-hf_replicate_n1jl0091
optimised files to run video-llama-7b-hf on replicate as a public model

Process for uploading this model to replicate to ensure quick booting time:
- Downloaded weights locally from hugging face
- Added to directory
- Pushed to replicate
- Much faster load speeds!

Other Failed Methods
- Replicate CDN: only used for in replicate not for end users
- Hugging Face Transfer: works, but not quick enough
- Alternative CDN network: expensive
